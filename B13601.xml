            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>two mites,</hi> though they very little increased the stock; yet were accepted as well as the great abundance, which the rich men cast into the treasurie. To which mites I may fitly resemble these my poore labours, as being of no value in themselves: which therefore I had wholly suppressed, if I had not been confident that God doth more respect the heart and affection of the giver, then the worth and value of the gift. Resolving then upon these motives to give way to the importunitie of my friends, I conceived that the
<pb facs="tcp:2613:3"/> more I was conscious to mine own infirmitie, the more it concerned me to make choice of some noble and worthy Patron, under whose protection I might presume to shrowd these first-fruits of my labours. And therefore, after some serious thoughts passed in that kinde, I was for speciall reasons induced humbly to crave your Lordships favour; both to accept of these my rude and indigested Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, as a testimonie of the obsequious love and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I have for many yeares born towards your Honour: and also to vouchsafe to suffer them to passe under your noble protection.</p>
                  <p>First, because some of these Sermons were delivered in the Lecture at Kettering, when your Lordship vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to be a principall member of that Societie: which gave me no small hope, that you would the rather cast a favourable aspect both upon me, and these my poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because the principall end, and scope of these Sermons is to preach <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> the summe and substance of the Practick part of Christian Religion: whereof your Lordship hath given many rare examples. To which no small lustre is added, in that your Lordship hath not left these works of <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Charitie</hi> to be performed by your Executors: but you have seen the complement and perfection of them while you are yet living. Which both the Ʋniversities, and divers other places (to your immortall fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown) do daily, and will perpetually testifie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I was the rather encouraged to presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Lordships favourable acceptance, because that you have not onely ever been a noble Patron of all good learning: but also you have shewed singular respect to
<pb facs="tcp:2613:4"/> such as you have found industrious and painfull in the Church of God. And therefore I shall think my self hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if in the small remainder of my dayes, I may bestow my strength and labours, or be my self bestowed to benefit the Church of God, and do your Lordship any kinde of service, though in the least and smallest degree.</p>
                  <p>Thus was I animated to present this small volume, together with my humble service unto your Lordship, hoping that you will vouchsafe to cast the wing of your protection over it, and favourably accept of my poore endeavours. To which my humble request if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall vouchsafe to condescend; I shall not fear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting calumnies of Cynicall censurers, but think my self to be safe under the favour of so worthy a person: whom God hath exalted to such eminent place both in the Church, and Common-wealth.

                  <p>Onely in handling the sacred Scriptures, it hath ever been my desire (by the help of Expositours and the small insight which God hath given me in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tongues) to endeavour throughly to indigate and search out the drift and scope of the Spirit of God, and the true sense and interpretation of the words, before I presume to build any thing upon them. Wherein I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I do runne a contrary course to that novell conceit of many amongst us at this day; which blush not (in private discourse) to vent their too nice and fantasticall opinion, that the time which is spent in the pulpit in interpretation (if it exceed a short paraphrase consisting of a few words) is but lost; and that it is not preaching, untill we say this is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Which superficiall handling of the word of God (now too much practised in publick) I can resemble to nothing more aptly, then to erecting a large and goodly structure upon the superficies of the earth, without dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or searching for firm ground whereon to place the foundation thereof: which therefore is by every storm or violent blast shaken and endangered, if not overthrown and ruined.</p>

That man sleepeth soundly indeed, whom the sound of a trumpet cannot awake: how soundly therefore do they sleep, or rather lie dead in sinne, whom the ratling of thunder, even the terrible thunder-claps of mount Sinai cannot cause to startle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and look about them?

                     <hi>There shall come in the last dayes scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming, &amp;c.</hi> And he knew no better means to rouse men out of this carnall securitie or spirituall Lethargie, then by causing them to understand the great peril and danger wherein they lie, who sleep secure in sinne, being environed with mighty, cruell, and raging enemies, which seek to devoure both their souls and bodies. And therefore to the same end and purpose, I thought I could not do better then to tread in his stepps, and give warning in his words; assuring my self, that he whom neither the love of his own salvation, nor the fear of hell, nor this roaring lion will move, is already dead in sinne, and past hope of recovery. But he that is touched either with the love of the one, or fear of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will no longer snort in sinfull securitie; but <hi>Wake,</hi> and <hi>Watch,</hi> and meet his enemy in the face, and fight valiantly and couragiously for his soul and his salvation. And to move every one of us so to do, let us now open and consider the words of the Apostle, which I have made choice of to that end and purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be sober, be vigilant: because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devoure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words (as may appeare to the meanest capacity) do naturally divide themselves into two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 An Exhortation in the former words, <hi>Be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, be vigilant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2613:8"/>2. A Reason or Motive drawn from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wherein we stand, being continually assaulted by a fierce and cruell enemie, seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us; <hi>Because your adversary the Devil as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though this be the naturall order of the words, yet because I am perswaded that I shall better and more fully enforce and apply the Exhortation, if I raise it from the Reason or Motive; I desire (with your patience) to speak first in order, of that which is last in place, in the words of my text; viz. of the Reason or Motive, which I desire to lay down as a generall ground or Point of doctrine; and then from thence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>First, The Reason, or Motive, <hi>Because your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Devil as a roaring lion &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The scope of the Apostle in these words, is to set before our eyes, as it were in perfect and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours, the exceeding great danger whereunto we are lyable by reason of our spirituall Arch-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: who doth daily besiege, assault, and fight against our souls. And to bring us to a full sight and knowledge of this danger, he hath here described this our spirituall Arch-enemy unto us to the full in a fourefold manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From his name, <hi>The Devil:</hi>

                  <p>It is not requisite in this place curiously to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, or define what the Devil is: it is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known that he was at the first created by God a glorious angel of light, perfectly good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and placed in heaven. Onely he was not <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilis in bono,</hi> that is, <hi>Immutably good;</hi> which is a property peculiar to God alone: and therefore by sinne he lost his first estate, was thrown down from heaven, and of an angel of light became an impure spirit, the most accursed of all creatures: and, as S. Peter speaketh,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.4.</note>
                     <hi>God cast</hi> him <hi>down, and delivered</hi> him <hi>into chains of darknesse to be reserved unto judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> or as the former translation did read, <hi>to be kept unto damnation.</hi> That which is more to my present purpose, is to consider him (according to the scope and intent of the Apostle in this place) as he is an enemie unto mankinde. Indeed his hatred and malice was at the first, and principally bent against God himself; because in his just judgement he despoiled him, or deprived him of his state of glory &amp; felicitie, and condemned him to eternall and unavoidable torments. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately thereupon he did, and alwaies doth by all means to the uttermost of his power, seek to obscure and hinder the glory of God, and to oppose himself against God. But (as one saith well) <hi>Quia in Deum nihil potest, insidiatur homini, qui ad imaginem ejus factus est:</hi> Because he cannot prevail against God the omnipotent Creator, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2613:9"/> turneth his malice against the creatures; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them principally against man the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all creatures, whom God hath made after his own Image.

                     <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 3.4.</note> which is no lesse then to give God the lie.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. He accused God of Envy, pretending that the cause why he did forbid them to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, was not (as God had said) because <hi>they should die in the day wherein they did eat thereof;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew that when they did eat thereof,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note>
                     <hi>Their eyes should be opened, and they should be as Gods, knowing good and evill:</hi> and therefore that the true cause why God did forbid them to eat thereof, was, because he envied them so happy and glorious an estate. And he runneth still the same course in wicked and ungodly persons, teaching them to cast the aspersion of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sinnes and nefarious lives upon God: for what is more common then to heare an ungodly person, being reproved for his hellish and stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall villanies, belch out some execrable, or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous speech or other against God, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? saying, It is my destinie; I cannot help it: If God had made me otherwise, I would have done otherwise; or some other such like cursed words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he is no lesse malicious in slandering and accusing of man also unto God; for he it is that is alwaies ready (when we have sinned) to cry out against us, and accuse us, requiring of God (according to the strict rule of his justice) not to spare us being offenders, but to poure down vengeance upon our heads, having justly deserved punishment. And of this we have sufficient proof, from the testimony, or confession of his own mouth in the first chapter of Job; where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2613:11"/> unto the Lord, that he had been<note n="s" place="margin">Job 1.7.</note>
                     <hi>compassing the earth, going to and fro, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in it,</hi> like a Promoter, or Informer, to spie out faults and offences, whereof he might accuse them unto God. But if his own confession be not sufficient, we have also the expresse testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit of God, to confirm it. For so in the Revelation of S. John, we finde that he being overcome by Michael and his Angels, and cast out of heaven, there was a loud voice heard, saying in heaven,<note n="t" place="margin">Revel. 12.7, 5.</note>
                     <hi>Now is come salvation, &amp; strength, and the kingdome of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the Accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day &amp; night.</hi> Nay, he is not onely an Accuser of us, but also (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his name) a false slanderer, and malicious back-biter: for he doth not onely accuse us for the sinnes which we have indeed committed, but also wresteth our good actions, and exclaimeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us for them, pretending that they are done either in hypocrisie, or for some by; and sinister respect, &amp;c. Yea, if he can espie but an appearance of evil in us, he will not stick to accuse us, that we have already committed that evil, whereof he doth but suspect us: so wresting and misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our actions to the worst sense, and making of every molehill an huge mountain. Thus wrongfully did he slander Job, that he served God for that same end, for which Demetrius<note n="u" place="margin">Acts 19.24</note> served his Goddesse Diana: viz. for advantage, for gain, or profit, saying,<note n="x" place="margin">Job 1.9, 10, 11.</note>
                     <hi>Doth Job fear God for nought? hast thou not made an hedge about him, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2613:12"/> about his house, and about all that he hath on every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side? Thou hast blessed the works of his hand, and his substance is increased in the land: But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</hi> Thus doth he accuse and slander Man to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, he practiseth the same course likewise between Man and Man, by his calumnies, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and false lies, sowing the seeds of all manner of discord, strife, contention, sedition and warre between them: and by that means many times he causeth those that before were intire friends, to become mortall enemies.

Thus doth he maliciously deprave and slander God to Man, Man to God, and one Man unto another: and therefore he is rightly called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The second part of the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is taken from his Nature or disposition; not simply as he is in himself, but with relation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2613:12"/> to us, or in respect of mankinde. The originall word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>adversarium in causa vel lite;</hi> it is a Law terme, and signifieth one that is <hi>an Adversary to another in his cause, suit, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the law.</hi> And such an enemie or Adversary the Devil indeed is to all the children of God in the cause or action concerning their salvation: opposing himself against it, and bending all his force with might and main to hinder it. As Christ is our Advocate making intercession for us, and pleading our cause unto God, according to that of the Apostle,<note n="a" place="margin">1. John 2.1</note>
                     <hi>If any man sinne, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</hi> So Satan on the other part is a Sergeant, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or Proctour, with all earnestnes and virulency pleading against us, and our salvation. And because he is not as a Counsellour retained by another against us, or pleading for his fee; but is his own Proctour in his own cause: he is rightly here called our <hi>Adversary,</hi> viz. which in his own cause plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his own person against us, seeking by all means to hinder our salvation, and to procure the sentence of condemnation from the mouth of the Judge against us. And Beza<note n="b" place="margin">In Annot. majoribus.</note> well observeth, that the force of the Greek article here is not to be omitted, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>Ille Adversarius, that your Adversary:</hi> Because though we have many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, yet he is (as one saith) <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the most warlike and malicious; as it were the Coripheus or arch-enemie of our souls and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. Or else, because that though there be

                     <hi>Legions of Devils,</hi> and all of them our adversaries: yet the Apostle here aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at<note n="d" place="margin">Matt. 9.12.34.</note>
                     <hi>Beelzebub the Prince of Devils,</hi> under whose banner all the rest of those infernall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do fight against us.</p>
                  <p>And indeed he may well he called our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary pleading against us; because he is still rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hinder and crosse us in all our suits and prayers which we send up unto God, and in all other our godly purposes and proceedings. So, when Jehoshuah the High Priest stood before the Angel of the Lord ready to make interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the behalf of the people, Satan<note n="e" place="margin">Zach. 3.1.</note>
                     <hi>stood at his right hand, to resist him,</hi> or as it is in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, <hi>to be his Adversary:</hi> which agreeth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the terme or title here given unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by the Spirit of God. And again, we reade that<note n="f" place="margin">1. Chron. 21.1.</note>
                     <hi>Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number the people:</hi> whereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Gods heavy displeasure against them, by the devouring pestilence, whereby there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. And so likewise when a good Angel was sent from God unto Daniel,<note n="g" place="margin">Daniel 10.13.</note> He was <hi>withstood by an evill Angell, one and twenty dayes, till Michael came and helped him.</hi> And Saint Paul writing to the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, saith,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Thess. 2.18.</note>
                     <hi>We would have come unto you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindred us.</hi> Thus doth Satan appeare to be truely called our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary: viz. as opposing himself alwaies against us, both in the cause of our salvation, and also in all other holy actions, and godly endeavours. Which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2613:13"/> was the reason why Saint Paul used those words to Elymas the sorcerer when he withstood Paul and Barnabas preaching the word of God at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, and sought to turn away the Deputy from the faith, saying,<note n="i" place="margin">Acts 13.6, 7, 8, 9, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>He cometh and catcheth away that which was sown in the heart,</hi> that it may not bring forth fruit in the life and conversation.

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, he is in the next place described unto us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> by his continuall practise against us, in those words, <hi>As a roaring lion walketh about.</hi> Wherein observe with me two things.</p>

And some Expositors conceive this phrase of <hi>walking about,</hi> to be a Metaphor taken <hi>à rebus bellicis, from warlike affairs,</hi> thus: Like as a wise and politick Captain or Generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging some citie or castle, fetcheth his compasse about, and diligently vieweth each part thereof, to the end that discovering the weakest part, he might take his advantage, planting his ordinance for battery; and after a breach made give an assault there: So also the Devil, the grand captain of all those hellish troups and forces which fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our souls, laying continuall siege against the Church of God, and every faithfull soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in a subtill and politick manner walketh about to and fro with uncessant pains and vigilancy, to spie and discover when and where we are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: that so taking the opportunitie and advantage, he may suddenly with all violence and fury charge upon us, and so discomfit us, to our utter ruine and destruction.

                     <hi>Judah is a Lions whelp: from the prey, my sonne, thou art gone up: he stouped down, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion: who shall rouse him up?</hi> Which he spake to foreshew, that that tribe should be more warlike and powerfull then the other tribes; and should for a long time possesse the scepter and kingdome over them all. And when the Prophet would describe God as a mighty warriour vindicating his people from the power of their enemies, he useth this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a Lion, saying,<note n="x" place="margin">Isaiah 31.4</note>
                     <hi>Like as the Lion, and the young Lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Sion, and for the hill thereof.</hi> And so also by the comparison of a Lion doth Homer set forth Diomedes; and Virgil doth the like in the story of Aeneas.</p>

                     <hi>The Lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesie?</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. By reason of his cruelty and rapacitie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ravenous, and living upon the prey, he doth represent both wicked and bloudy Tyrants, and also the Devil himself.</p>
                  <p>Now then our Apostle in this place applieth it to the Devil, thereby to set forth the manner of Satans practise, or walking about. And indeed it doth fitly agree unto him, in the first and third acception: and so this comparison doth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expresse unto us two things in our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie the Devil:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Strength and might, as he is the king of beasts excelling in power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bloudy cruelty, as he is a beast of prey, living upon the spoil.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostle by comparing him to a Lion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> would imply unto us that he is a mighty, strong, and powerfull Adversary: so that (if the Lord should permit him so to do) he is able to raise the winde, and stirre up tempests (as he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Jobs<note n="z" place="margin">Job. 1.19.</note> sonnes, thereby beating down the house upon their heads) or to bring down fire from above (as he did upon Jobs<note n="a" place="margin">verse 16.</note> sheep and shepherds, consuming them) and to work a strange confusion suddenly amongst the creatures placed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2613:17"/> here below the heavens. And therefore is he by the Holy Ghost compared to those creatures that are most strong both in the sea, &amp; on the land. So in this place he is compared to a Lion, the king &amp; mightiest of the beasts; yea to a roaring Lion, which hunting after his prey, hath his strength redoubled by his hunger.

                     <hi>Great red Dragon, having seven heads and ten horns:</hi> whose strength was so great, that <hi>his tail drew the third part of the starres of heaven, and did cast them to the earth.</hi> And elsewhere he is called<note n="c" place="margin">Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And secondly, the Spirit of God compareth him to beasts, to teach us to expect nothing from him, but beastly and brutish cruelty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he here compared to a lion roaring after his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2613:18"/> prey; which is so hungry, &amp; ravenous, that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing so much, as to seise upon &amp; devoure that which he pursueth. He hunteth as fiercely and greedily after the souls of men, as the hungry roaring lion doth after the bodies of those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he useth to prey upon: yea herein he farre exceedeth the Lion, whereunto he is compared: for the Lion rageth but against the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whereas his malice is chiefly bent against the soul: and whereas the Lion devoureth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men and beasts onely to satisfie his hunger, the Devil practiseth the same cruelty against mens souls for sport and pastime, onely because he delighteth in bloud and cruelty. And therefore is he fitly compared to <hi>the great red Dragon:</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Revel. 12.3.</note> of which kinde of beasts Plinie and others which write the naturall historie of the creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the same thing, viz. that he devoureth the bodies of men, not onely for hunger, but also for pleasure and delight. It is manifest by the history of the Gospel written by the foure Evangelists, that the Devil, this roaring Lion, exerciseth great cruelty upon the bodies of them whom he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; horribly vexing, and miserably excruciating &amp; abusing his members. He draweth their mouthes awry, stoppeth their breath, causeth their tongues to hang out of their mouthes, writhes their necks about, sinks their eyes into their heads, rolleth their bodies together like a ball, and<note n="m" place="margin">Mark 9.18, 22.</note>
                     <hi>tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that they fome and gnash their teeth, and pine away, and ofttimes casteth them into the fire and into the water to destroy them.</hi> This is evident by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2613:18"/> the examples of those whom our Saviour Christ dispossessed, and by divers others, which have been in lamentable manner possessed and abused by him. But if I could as fully expresse the rage and cruelty exercised by him upon the souls of the damned, which come into his possession: you would confesse all the former torments inflicted upon the bodies of such as are possessed by him, to be but as a flea-biting, as a sport or pastime, or as a nothing in comparison thereof. Whether we speak of the wofull horrours and tormenting pains of a guilty &amp; despairing conscience in this life (the horrour whereof no tongue is able to expresse, nor can it be fully discerned but by lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) or of the cruelty which he inflicteth upon the souls of the damned in the infernall pit. Whereof Bernard giveth us a shadow or glimpse, in these words,<note n="n" place="margin">

                        <item>1. With might and power.</item>
                        <item>2. with bloudy and brutish crueltie.</item>

                  <p n="4">4. The last part of our Apostles description, of this our mortall enemie, is taken <hi>à fine,</hi> from the end which he aimeth at in all this whereof we have spoken, <hi>Seeking whom he may devoure.</hi> And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2613:19"/> here again observe with me these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His diligence, expressed in the phrase of <hi>Seeking.</hi>

Indeed it is written of the Lion, that he is of that royall and generous disposition, that he spareth those that submit themselves before him, and lie prostrate at his feet: but if they once offer to depart from him, then in his rage he fasteneth his paws upon them, and teareth them in pieces. And in like manner, the roaring Lion of hell doth sometimes spare the wicked and ungodly for the present, when they yeeld, and submit themselves unto him, to be led by him: but if they once offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, or but to turn their faces towards heaven; he presently sheweth himself in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and like a develish fiend seeketh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure their bodies and souls.

                  <p>Sobriety is commonly opposed to Ebriety, and therefore the Schoolmen affirm, that it is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall nothing else, but <hi>Abstinentia ab omni inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ativo, Abstinencie from every thing that doth inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or cause drunkennesse.</hi> And we are hereto consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der farther, that there is both a double Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2613:22"/> and a twofold Ebriety. The one carnall of the body: And the other spirituall, of the soul, or inward man. Ebrietie of the body, is when it is distempered by the immoderate use of wine, or some such other things, which do trouble the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and intoxicate the brain. Ebriety of the soul, is when it is spiritually drunk with the sweetnesse of pleasures, lusts, and concupiscence or with Idolatrie, and the<note place="margin">Apoc. 17.4.</note>

And on the contrary, sobriety both of soul and body doth appeare to be nothing else, but a continuall abstinence from all such things as cause any distemper, surfet, or drunkennesse, either in soul or body. For so Augustine saith,<note n="o" place="margin">August.</note>

And therefore doth the Apostle so earnestly exhort us, <hi>Be sober.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Vigilancie, or watchfulnesse; <hi>Be vigilant.</hi> This is the other grace or vertue required of us: and it is a Metaphor taken <hi>a rebus bellicis, from war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affairs.</hi> For like as when any citie, fort, or castle is besieged; or when an army lieth in the open field; they never dare give themselves over wholly to security; but alwaies night and day have their Scouts, Sentinells, or Corps-du-guard, to keep watch and ward, lest the enemie sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching, and taking his advantage, should surprize them and destroy them. So likewise Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan with all his troups and hellish forces, lying in wait, and continually besieging our souls, seeking to destroy, or devoure them, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle requireth that we never give our selves over to sinfull securitie, but that we be vigilant, and keep a continuall watch and ward against the enemies of our souls, and our salvation. And this vigilancy and watchfulnesse is partly of the body, &amp; partly of the soul. The bodily watching is a moderate abstinence from naturall sleep, to the end that we may give our selves to prayer, and be the more fit to perform other godly and Christian duties. The vigilancy of the soul is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2613:23"/> when we do not rest secure in our sinnes being rockt asleep in the cradle of carnall securitie; but do shake off our spirituall drowsinesse by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned repentance, &amp; rising to newnesse of life. To which also the words of the Apostle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians do very fitly agree; <hi>Awake to live righteously,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.34.</note>
                     <hi>and sin not.</hi> Whereby it appeares, that to live righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and not to sinne, is to keep the spirituall watch. Now both these kindes of vigilancy are here required of us, but especially that of the soul: though the body of necessity must sometimes sleep, yet the soul should never sleep in sinne and securitie: but it is our parts herein to be like unto the Spouse, which saith, <hi>I sleep,</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note>

And therefore doth the Apostle here so instantly urge the necessity of this vigilancy. And so doth our Saviour Christ also,<note n="r" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Mitting all circumstantiall pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, concerning Solomon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or this book in generall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceived to be penned by him in testimony of his repentance; observe with me, that this present chapter consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of two chief branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the first he exhorteth to the duty of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and bounty, in releeving the poore, in the six first verses.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the other he laboureth to withdraw men from sinne and impietie by inculcating the memoriall and infallible necessity of death, and the judgement to come, from the sixth verse to the end of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>My purpose is, not to speak any thing at this time concerning the latter branch; which pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the matter which is now to be treated of: But in the first part observe with me, that the Wise man doth with varietie of reasons, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, allegories, and allusions, urge and inforce the duty of Charity, or almes-deed. Take a short view of them.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:2613:30"/>
                  <p>In the first verse he propounds the duty in an Allegory, and presseth it with a strong reason; <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt finde it after many dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next verse he expoundeth the former Metaphor or Allegorie, and strengtheneth it with another forcible motive; <hi>Give a portion to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and also to eight, for thou knowest n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t what evil shall be upon the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third he allureth us to the practise of this duty, by a double allusion from the clouds and the trees: <hi>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the earth; and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth he laboureth to remove the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary obstacles which hinder the practise of this duty; as stumbling at the ingratitude of the poore, curiosity about their persons, whether they be worthy to be received or not, posting off the duty till a more fit time, &amp;c. <hi>He that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the winde, shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds, shall not reap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fifth verse he answereth this objection; How shall I know that after many dayes I shall finde it? which way, or wherein may that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare? Which doubt or scruple he satisfieth by a reason, or demonstration, drawn from the secret manner of Gods works in the winde, or spirit, and in an Embryo: <hi>As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the wombe of her that is with childe; even so thou
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2613:30"/> knowest not the works of God, who maketh all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the last verse of this part he concludeth with an Exhortation to the diligent practise of this duty, not conditioning before-hand with God, but leaving the successe to him, trusting him in the point of remuneration: <hi>In the morning sow thy seed, in the evening withhold not thy hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of all these I have made choice of the first, to be the subject of my discourse at this time; <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt finde it after many dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Solomon by his great wisdome had formerly discovered a disease, which doth much haunt riches, or rather rich men:<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 5.10.</note>
                     <hi>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this is also vanity.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse is a spirituall dropsy.<note n="b" place="margin">Ovid. <hi>1.</hi> F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Quò plus sunt potae, plùs sitiuntur aquae; The more men drink of such waters, the more their thirst after increaseth.</hi> Now the Preacher being a spirituall physician, before the conclusion of his sermons, prescribeth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, medicine, or remedy, for this maladie. And herein he proceedeth according to the true methode of healing: for having discovered the cause of the disease to be a kinde of Plethorie, or fulnesse, or an infallible desire of riches, which we commonly call avarice; he proceedeth in the cure thereof, according to the generall physicall rule, <hi>Contraria curantur per contraria; Contraries are best cured by contraries:</hi> and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2613:31"/> that the cure, or remedie be by evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters.</hi> For like as when evil humours grow predominant in the body, if there be not some evacuation by incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, phlebotomie, purgation, &amp;c. they do in time suffocate the body, and hasten the ruine thereof: So do evil affections, being predominant in the heart or minde, (without some spirituall means for evacuation) endanger the destruction of the soul. And therefore the Wise man hath here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prescribed a medicine, and such a one, as (being rightly applied) will not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the cure of the former disease, <hi>viz.</hi> by evacuation, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters.</hi> For (as one saith truely) this vice cannot be washed away, <hi>nisi per fontem liberalitatis, but by the fountain of liberalitie:</hi> for so Zaccheus professed that he would<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 19.8.</note>
                     <hi>give the half of his goods to the poore, and make restitution foure-fold of whatsoever he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from any man by false accusation,</hi> or forgery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour Christ said unto him,<note place="margin">vers. 9.</note>
                     <hi>This day is salvation come unto thine house.</hi> But that I may speak briefly and methodically, observe with me in these words two parts.</p>

                  <p>The Precept is in these former words, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters:</hi> wherein the scope of the Spirit of God is, to excite men to boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberalitie, or munificence, in releeving of the poore: a doctrine if needfull in those daies and that golden age of plenty, wherein silver was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing accounted of; (for<note n="d" place="margin">1.

                     <hi>the king gave silver in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem as stones,</hi> or (as some read) <hi>made it as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as stones</hi>) then how much more now? For this is the age, and these seem to be the times wherein the Apostle fore-prophesied, that men should be<note n="e" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.2</note>

                     <hi>that iniquitie should abound, and the love of many wax cold.</hi> And therefore if Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, much more hath the Preacher cause now to say, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters:</hi> especially at this season, when the hand of God doth presse so strongly by<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <p>That I may the better open the whole scope of it, observe therein these three circumstances.</p>

                  <p>The consideration of these will open the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2613:32"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unto you. 1. We are to consider the action or manner of the duty, in that one word, <hi>Cast.</hi> The whole verse is a continued Metaphor, that is, an Allegorie taken <hi>a re rustica,</hi> from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and use in husbandry, requiring a seeding in the beginning, and promising an harvest in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. And so have we in this first part of my text, the Precept, 1. The sowing, <hi>Cast.</hi> 2. The seed, <hi>thy bread.</hi> 3. The field wherein it is to be sowen, <hi>upon the waters.</hi> Neither let any one think it a strange or farre-fetched Allegorie; for the Spirit of God in the writings of S. Paul, hath both familiarly used it, and also at large prosecuted it: for exhorting the Corinthians to charitie and almesdeeds, he saith,<note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 9.6, 9, 10.</note>
                     <hi>He which soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully:</hi> and further pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that allusion in certain verses following, as Solomon hath also done in the beginning of this chapter; which (by the way) admirably shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the harmony and consent of holy Scriptures, being dictated by the same Spirit. So is charitie in giving to the poore, compared to sowing of seed; and the Metaphor of <hi>Casting</hi> implieth with what minde &amp; affection it ought to be performed; <hi>viz.</hi> as the husbandman soweth his seed, cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, freely, and liberally. To which end it is, that (as the<note n="k" place="margin">Aristot.</note> Philosopher observeth) <hi>Deus fecit manum aptam ad spargendum; God hath framed the composition of the hand in a fit manner for scattering or sowing, with incisions, or divisions of the fingers, for vents in the action of sowing:</hi> as if every one of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2613:32"/> them (in the spirituall seeding) should be a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vent or passage for our bounty. The whole hand being like<note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 5.2.</note>
                     <hi>Bethesda,</hi> the house of mercy, with his five porches, pipes, or conduits. And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid speaking of the same duty of charity, useth another word agreeing to this,<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 112.9</note>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>dispersit: He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poore, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse endureth for ever.</hi> And indeed, that is the best kinde of charity which is so dispersed or scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad. Many littles given unto many being in distresse, is better then much conferred upon one; more being refreshed by our bounty, &amp; more thanksgiving redounding unto God thereby. But let me observe with you, that the Metaphor of <hi>Casting,</hi> doth chiefly imply two things in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our professing the duty of charity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it be performed freely: for who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the husbandman to cast or sow his seed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his land? it is his own free and voluntary act,<note place="margin">Liberè, freely</note> cheerefully and willingly performed in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a future harvest. So ought this our spirituall casting or sowing, to be free and uncompelled; as (to use S. Pauls own words)<note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor. 9.7</note>
                     <hi>not grudgingly, or of necessitie: for God loveth a cheerefull giver.</hi> It is called <hi>Eleemosyna, a work of mercy;</hi> which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be properly called, except it be <hi>libera, non coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, free and without compulsion.</hi> If it be by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, it is obedience to a commandment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not a work of mercy, wherein mercie and compassion should be the <hi>primum movens, the first mover.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it be done liberally, or bountifully:<note place="margin">Liberaliter, liberally.</note>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:2613:33"/> for what wise husbandman will (as we say) pinch his land of seed? what hope shall he then have of a rich and plentifull harvest? And what saith S.

                     <hi>he which soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he which soweth liberally, shall reap liberally.</hi> And therefore also doth Solomon here after the words of my text, so earnestly presse this circumstance of liberalitie and bounty; <hi>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight.</hi> And again, <hi>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>quantum</hi> or proportion can hardly be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, because it is to be measured both according to the ability of him that giveth, and also the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of him that receiveth.

                  <p>The malice of our arch-adversary, Satan, is well known to God; <hi>viz.</hi> that like as he hath been alwayes busied with the best men, so doth he most strongly oppose himself against the best things, and consequently against the prime duty of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or almes-deeds. For (as one saith truely)<note n="y" place="margin">Chrysost. in locum.</note>
                     <hi>Dilectionis flammas Satan ferre non potest: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can by no means endure the burning flames of love and charitie.</hi> As in all goodnesse, so especially in this he opposeth himself against God: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. 9.7.</note>
                     <hi>God loveth a cheerefull giver,</hi> he loves a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nabal, and miserable Dives: whereas God saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 6.35, 38.</note>
                     <hi>Lend, hoping for nothing again:</hi> and, <hi>Give, and it shall be given to you:</hi> he saith, Yea, but <hi>a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</hi> And therefore the Lord knowing his malice in this kinde, doth not here content himself with a bare command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but also allureth us with a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. He that might peremptorily require, doth in a sort intreat; and he that might absolutely command, is willing <hi>tanquam conducere praemia; as it were to hire us for a reward; Thou shalt finde it after many dayes.</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">In locum.</note> Lavator observeth, that it is in the Originall, <hi>In the multitude of dayes: Which</hi> (saith he) <hi>implyeth, that God will prolong the dayes of his life, that soweth upon these waters: for if he live not long, how can he finde it in or after a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of dayes?</hi> But that doth not so necessarily
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2613:38"/> follow alwayes; for as God doth remunerate the bountie and liberalitie of some in one kinde, and of others in another; so he doth it to some sooner, and to others later; some finding it in themselves, and some in their posterity; some in this life, and some in the life to come. Abundantly sufficient it is, that God interposeth himself as the poore mans surety, and bindeth himself by promise to repay the debt: <hi>Thou shalt finde it again after many dayes.</hi> It had been no injustice in him, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired absolute giving; but he is content that we shall but lend, and he himself will become both the pledge and the pay-master; <hi>After many dayes thou shalt finde it again:</hi> for that is the true sense of this place. Though that which is cast upon these waters seemeth utterly to be lost; (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed) yet it is not so, it is but lent, and the Lord will repay it.

                  <p n="1">1. The first interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Some suppose that Christ here speaketh of that fall of <hi>Satan,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Lucifer;</hi> whereby in the beginning, presently after the creation (as the most do suppose) for his pride and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption against God, he was by the Almighty, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Angels which adhered to him,

                     <hi>Thou saidst, I will ascend into heaven,</hi> that he was not in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                     <hi>You bring me word with joy that the devils are subdued unto you through my name; wherein you shew me no new thing: for when at the first I sent you forth to preach, I knew before that the power and kingdome of Satan would be ruined by the power of the Gospel: and when and where you preached it, I saw him fall from heaven, and all his strength and force to vanish.</hi> And so in this sense the Lord Jesus would bring his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples (sticking with amazement in the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that miracle, that the devils were subdued unto them through his name) to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the power and efficacy of the ministery of the Gospel, whereby it is that the devil is cast out of his whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or heaven upon earth.

                  <p>But whether you take it <hi>Generally,</hi> or <hi>Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it tends (for the main) to the same end; <hi>viz.</hi> To shew that the prime means whereby the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan is ruined, and he cast down from his heaven on earth, is by the power and efficacy of the Gospel preached. <hi>Collocatur Satan in aere cum suis Angelis:</hi> (saith<note n="h" place="margin">In annotat. major.</note> Beza) <hi>Inde vero dicitur detrudi, &amp; quidem cum impetu, quando voce Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelit ejus potestas aboletur.

                  <p n="1">1. Because the generall end and scope of all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> preaching, and all your hearing the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is thereby to raze and beat down the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of sinne and Satan; and to erect, build up, and establish the kingdome of Christ Jesus. The Priests of the Lord of Hosts must sound the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trumpets of the word of God very loud, and that<note n="a" place="margin">Josh. 6.19.</note>

                     <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because I am to speak in these last dayes of sinne and apostasie, wherein our iniquities do send up a louder cry then the bloud of<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 4.10.</note> Abel, into the eares of the Lord of Hosts for vengeance against us. And therefore this is no time to<note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 13.18</note>
                     <hi>sow pillows</hi> under mens elbowes. The sweet songs of Sion serve now but to lull men more soundly asleep in sinne: the terrible thunder-claps of Mount Sinai are more fit to rouze them up, and make them startle and awake from the dead sleep of carnall securitie. And therefore to that end and purpose have I made choice of these words, which in the shallow reach of my judgement are pregnant and powerfull to that purpose. <hi>I will go and return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my place, untill they acknowledge their fault, and seek my face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In handling of these words (remembring to avoid that imputation or complaint of Bernard, that <hi>Multi student magìs alta, quàm apta proferre; Many study to produce such things as may rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse deepnesse, then tend to edification;</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a mournfull habit, suiteth best for an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and tragicall discourse) I will strive rather to touch the conscience to the quick by the piercing power of the word of God, then to please itching eares with curious deepnesse, or with a compt stile, and filed phrase of speech. For I had rather wring the teares of unfeigned repentance from the eyes, and the sighs and groans of true contrition from the heart of one poore penitent sinner, then by sweet and delicate words to move the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that heare me.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2613:56"/>
                  <p>But the matter which I have singled out being so copious, and the limits of time being prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; I may not be so unthrifty as to spend any more thereof in such like preambles, lest in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I presse too farre upon your patience. And therefore omitting to speak of the authour, the time, and the generall Analysis or resolution of this whole Prophesie, I come now abruptly to open the words themselves.</p>
                  <p>I will go and return unto my place, till they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their fault, and seek my face.</p>
                  <p>The summe of these words is a Commination,<note place="margin">A Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the circumstances of it.</note> or a Denuntiation of an intended judgement. For the more absolute unfolding and applying where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto our selves, I desire you to consider with me foure circumstances.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of the first I shall speak somewhat sparingly, and in few words, not onely because they are not inserted in the very body of my text, though they be very requisite to the interpretation of it; but also because I do especially aim at the fourth and last, which is the text it self; <hi>I will go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, &amp;c.</hi>

It hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so both in the Scriptures and in Authors, diverse secondary or Metaphoricall significations.

But (under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) my opinion is, that the interpretation of Rabbi David Kimchi doth best agree with the place: And it is twofold; First, upon Lev. 4.13. he interpreteth the word to signifie, <hi>agnoscere deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, to confesse or acknowledge a sinne or fault:</hi> and elsewhere he taketh it to signifie,<note n="c" place="margin">In lib. rad.</note>

                     <hi>a sinne-offering,</hi> or <hi>offering for sinne.</hi> Now these two significations may well be joyned together into one: for he that confessed his sinne under the Law, brought an offering also to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it: and he that<note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 7.1.</note> brought an offering for his sinne, was bound to acknowledge and confesse it; or else it was in vain for him to bring an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. And so it is plain from hence, that the first thing which God aimed at, and expected from them, was that they should turn unto him in an humble acknowledgement and unfeigned confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their sinnes, which was not then to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without oblations or offerings, which were the legal means to obtain remission of sinnes.

From whence it appeareth, that the first step to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the knowledge, and acknowledging of our sinnes. And thus you see what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; which if he finde, then will he absent himself no longer, but graciously return again unto them; but till then he will not. And if they prove obdurate in sinne, and will never be moved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form these; then will he never return again to be graciously present any more with them, and to shew them <hi>the light of his countenance,</hi> but will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himself for ever, and leave them to perish.</p>

                  <p>Thus have I now delivered unto you the whole summe of these words; but yet have I not done with them. For hitherto you have heard of them but in the generall, or as they concerned the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>then</hi> Gods people: Now give me leave with your patience (I beseech you) to bring them a little nearer to our selves <hi>now</hi> Gods people, and make it our own case; for therein is the life of preaching. And to that end I intreat you to consider with me these three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether our sinnes be not like the sinnes of Israel and Judah, and come to the same height or degree with theirs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether the Lord hath not gone as farre with his comminations and judgements, and by the same steps with us, as he did with them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. First then, may we not compare with Israel and Judah for our sinnes?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2613:76"/> atheisme, idolatrie, lukewarmnesse, blasphemie, swearing, lying, cursing, sacriledge, theft, treason, contempt of Gods word, profanation of the Lords day, Sodomy, with such a catalogue of other sinnes, as my memorie faileth me to recite. Thus then we see in this first point Israel and Judah ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neare parallelled by ourselves, and in some sort farre out-stripped.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the next place, see if the Lord hath not dealt with us, and proceeded against us for these things in like manner as he did against them; wherein I must be brief, because the time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels me.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hath not the Lord been now for a long time, above fiftie yeares together, an admonisher of us all, by his holy word so graciously vouchsafed unto us under the late reigne of Queen Elisabeth of blessed memorie, and our dread Sovereigne, now happily swaying the scepter of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? what multitudes of<note n="t" place="margin">Matth. 9.38</note>

                     <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked all the ungodly</hi> among us, of all their wicked deeds, and sought by the terrours of Gods wrath and vengeance, to come to affright them from their ungodly wayes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Did not God threaten a fall to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, especially to the Church and state of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the bloudie Marian daies? whose heart did not then faint and quail within him, for the little hope that was left?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Was it any lesse then a desolation, which he

                  <p n="4">4. Did he not seem to poure out his wrath like water upon us, when he seconded blessed Queen Elisabeths death with such a continuing and devouring pestilence and famine, 1603.</p>

                     <hi>These things come by sinne provoking; and God is the more offended, since such and so great things do no good at all.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. If all this move us not, what can we expect in the next place, but that he proceed to the next, which is the last and highest degree, <hi>viz,</hi> that <hi>he go, and return unto his place;</hi> that is, withdraw his gracious presence from us, and leave us unto our selves, untill <hi>we acknowledge our fault, and seek his

                  <p n="3">3. I make no question but we all desire to be freed from these and other future judgements, and to continue the Lords gracious presence amongst us still. But alas! what do we in this case to have it so? Doth the Lord reap the end and fruit which he aimed at in all these things? Do we in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance turn unto the Lord our God, humbly confessing our sinnes, <hi>and acknowledging our faults?</hi> Do we seek his face and favour with all our hearts, and with all our souls?

                     <hi>Ite maledicti, &amp;c. Go ye cursed into everlasting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the devil and his Angels,</hi> to be carried with sighes and teares from God and his Angels, by the fiends of hell into the palace of eternall darknesse; <hi>Ʋbi clamabit pilosus ad pilosum,</hi> (saith<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <p>And certainly for my part here I cannot but admire, that men can talk of heaven, and hope for heaven; and yet live in all manner of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and sinne, as if God did even delight and take pleasure therein. But the truth is, that sinne is contrary to the nature of God, and therefore he cannot harbour sinners in his own bosome. God in the golden chain of our salvation, hath linked together <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory, holinesse</hi> and <hi>happinesse;</hi> and therefore whereas many would fain be <hi>happy</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:2613:78"/> in heaven, which regard not to be <hi>holy</hi> on earth; many desire to be <hi>glorified</hi> Saints in heaven, which will not be <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>mortified</hi> Saints on earth: Alas! they do but delude themselves with a vain hope; for God will never suffer the links of that golden chain to be violated or dissolved; but for ever <hi>grace</hi> shall be the way to <hi>glory,</hi> and onely <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi> shall lead to <hi>happinesse;</hi> for<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note>

Horrible presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is therefore, when blasphemers, idolaters, traitours, and filthy and profane persons shall think themselves fit companions for the God of heaven, and the thrice-blessed and sacred Trinitie.

                     <hi>he will not alwayes chide, nor keep his anger for ever,</hi> nor will he absent himself for ever. And the means to obtain his mercie, turn away his wrath, and retain his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence graciously amongst us, may from that which hath been spoken appeare to be twofold. The first concerneth some of us in <hi>particular:</hi> and the other respecteth all and every of us in <hi>generall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first hath relation to the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Right Reverend Judges of this land, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2613:79"/> with the rest of the Magistrates, and such as are in place of office and authoritie, <hi>viz.</hi> That at the sight of these great and manifold sinnes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, if not reigning in this land; their just and holy zeal and indignation inflame their hearts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against them with courage and resolution, seeking by the sword of justice put into their hands, to suppresse, and (so farre as lieth in their power) utterly extirpate and root them out. For the due execution of justice and judgement upon delinquents, and the due punishing and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sinne by Magistrates, is a speciall means to appease the wrath of God. So when the children of Israel had very grievously sinned by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whoredome with the daughters of Moab, the Lords wrath was fiercely kindled against them: but when<note n="u" place="margin">Num. 25.7.</note>
                     <hi>Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest</hi> (moved with zeal at the sight of the horrible villanie between Zimri, and Cozbi) <hi>took a javelin in his hand, and following them into the tent, thrust them both through, even through their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi> it was so acceptable to the Lord, and pleasing in his sight, that he said to Moses,<note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note>
                     <hi>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest, hath turned mine anger away from the children of Israel (while he was zealous for my sake among them) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousie.</hi> And in the time of Joshua, when Achan had offended in taking the execrable thing, the Lord would not be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards Israel, untill<note n="x" place="margin">Josh. 7.1, 24, 25.</note>
                     <hi>Achan with his sonnes, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had were stoned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2613:80"/> with stones, and burnt with fire.</hi> Likewise in the dayes of David the land was vexed with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous famine for three yeares together; and when<note n="y" place="margin">2. Sam. 21.1, 6.</note>
                     <hi>David asked counsel of the Lord,</hi> he found that it was because judgement was not executed upon the <hi>bloudy house of Saul,</hi> for the cruell and unjust daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Gibeonites. And therefore when <hi>seven men</hi> of the posteritie of Saul <hi>were taken and hanged up before the Lord in Gibeah,</hi> then the Lord was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased with the land. That was it which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jeremy said to Jehoiakim the sonne of Josiah;<note n="z" place="margin">Jer. 22.15,</note>
                     <hi>Did not thy father eat and drink, and prosper when he executed judgement and justice?</hi> And because he did not the like, treading in his fathers steps, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet denounced a fearfull curse against him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he should be buried as an asse is buried,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> even <hi>drawn and cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem.</hi> The Philosopher could say,<note n="a" place="margin">Aristotle</note>
                     <hi>Nec Hesperus, nec Lucifer formosior justitiâ; Neither the evening nor the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning starre is more glorious and beautifull in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, then justice is upon the earth.</hi> And certainly exceeding pleasing it is to the Almighty, when the<note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 82.6.</note>
                     <hi>gods on earth</hi> are like the God of heaven, just and impartiall to all whether great or small, refusing to <hi>know faces,</hi> that is,<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 24.13.</note>
                     <hi>respect persons in judgement;</hi> when the laws are not like spiders webs, to take the small or little ones, and let the strong and mighty break through; but <hi>Potentes potenter tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta patientur; the mighty offending, shall mightily suffer punishments:</hi> when they regard no mans person, or who he is; but his cause, and what he hath done against the Lord, remembring that it is his cause
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2613:80"/> and quarrell, and that (as Jehoshaphat said in his charge to the Judges)<note n="d" place="margin">2. Chr. 19.6</note>
                     <hi>the judgement is not theirs, but the Lords.</hi> To which agreeth that of Bernard, <hi>Qui recto &amp; composito Dei zelo ad poenam exigendam agitur, non suiipsius causam, sed Dei agendam suscipit: He that with a right and setled zeal of God is moved to inflict punishment, doth not undertake to manage his own, but Gods cause.</hi> May I then presume (Right Honourable) to put you in minde to be zealous for the Lord of hosts; remembring that idolatry, blasphemy, swearing, profanation of the Lords day, murder, adultery, oppression, and all other such like sinnes, are the Lords quarrells, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with zeal and resolution to be undertaken. For (as Hierome saith)<note n="e" place="margin">In Ezek. lib. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Homicidas, sacrilegos, &amp; venereos punire, non est effusio sanguinis, sed legum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterium; To punish murderers, sacrilegious, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious persons, is not shedding of bloud, but the due administration of the laws.</hi> So shall you be not the least part of the means to turn away the wrath of God from us, and continue his gracious presence amongst us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other concerneth us all in generall, without which the Lord will not be pacified, and return unto us with love and favour; and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the words of my text, <hi>viz.</hi> that we turn unto the Lord our God by true and unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>acknowledging our faults, and seeking his face.</hi> And this must be performed by all without exception: for as Chrysostomes comparison is, <hi>In cythera non satìs est, in uno tantùm nervo concentum efficere; universos oportet percuti, &amp; numerosè &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center:

Like as upon an harp it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the expression of a full harmony, to strike one string; but they must all be touched, and that in due measure and proportion: So that the melody of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may sound sweetly in the eares of the Lord, it is to be performed not by one, or by some few, but with an universall harmonie of all estates and degrees, and according to the rule and direction of the Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi> Let us therefore all and some, great and small, <hi>sorrow</hi> with Hezekiah, <hi>weep bitterly</hi> with Peter; let our hearts <hi>melt</hi> with Josiah, and let us with David<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>cease to do evil, and learn to do well:</hi> and then though <hi>our sinnes were as crimson, they shall be made white as snow: though they were red like scarlet, they shall be as wooll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh beloved, let us beware and be warned in time, let us be wiser then Israel and Judah; for they would not return, <hi>acknowledge their fault, and seek Gods face;</hi> and therefore you know what a wofull and unparallelled desolation did overtake them. <hi>Optimum est alienâ insaniá frui: Happy are we if their folly be our warning.</hi> God is indeed a God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and (as David saith)<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 145.9.</note>
                     <hi>his mercy is over all his works:</hi> yet is he also just, and if he be provoked too farre, <hi>Patientia laesa vertitur in furorem: His patience
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2613:81"/> too farre abused, turneth at the last into fury.</hi> Take heed therefore, for if the flie play too long with the candle, at the last she scorcheth her wings, and loseth her life; so if the sinner dallie too long with God, he is in danger of scorching his soul with the fire of hell, and perishing eternally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But we have peace and tranquillity (may some say) and therefore what relation hath all this to us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> We have the more cause to fear and look about us; for all this while the Lord doth but shew his forbearance, and expect our repentance: and if in stead thereof we continue wicked and ungodly, we shall in the end finde the truth of that of the Apostle,<note n="i" place="margin">1.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am loath to spend time in speaking by way of preamble, of the authour, or stile, and phrase of this epistle: Onely in brief, you may please to take notice, that the whole epistle is a kinde of Syllogism, though <hi>expansà manu, in a rhetoricall manner.</hi> The Proposition and Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof are in the former part, unto the words of my text: And the Conclusion from thence unto the end.</p>
                  <p>This whole verse that I have made choice to treat of at this time, is <hi>Oratio translatitia,</hi> a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed or figurative speech, or continued Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor throughout. The generall scope, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof, is matter of exhortation. And for orders sake, I divide it into two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The exhortation it self, or the matter whereunto we are exhorted, in these words, <hi>Let us runne the race that is set before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:2613:85"/>2. The circumstances whereby the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth his exhortation; which are these three:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An inducement or motive; <hi>Seeing that we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A direction how to prepare, &amp; fit our selves to the performance of the dutie to which we are exhorted; <hi>Casting away every thing that presseth down, and the sinne which hangeth so fast on us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner how we are to runne this race; <hi>With patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This shall suffice for the Analyticall resolution of the words; for these points thus enfolded in order, will (as I suppose) make the whole matter plain and evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are to consider the exhortation it self, in these words; <hi>Let us runne the race that is set before us.</hi> It is a Metaphoricall speech familiarly used in the writings of this Apostle, as appeareth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, but also in sundrie other places of his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: for so he speaketh to the Corinthians;<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.24</note>
                     <hi>Know ye not, that they which runne in a race, runne all; yet one receiveth the prize? So runne that ye may obtain.</hi> And to the Philippians;<note n="b" place="margin">Philip. 3.14</note> And <hi>follow hard towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi> And by this Metaphor the Apostle admonisheth us of the condition of our life, which is like a race, wherein runners do exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and strive for the prize. Chrysostom set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out this Metaphor more plainly and fully, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming <hi>our life,</hi> to be <hi>a race,</hi> the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>gospel,</hi> to be the <hi>two rails</hi> or <hi>lists; God</hi> and the <hi>Saints,</hi> to be <hi>spectatours:</hi> that <hi>we</hi> are the <hi>runners,</hi> and that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2613:85"/> is at the <hi>goale</hi> or <hi>mark,</hi> as a rewarder, to give the prize, which is eternall life. The life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a Christian is not (as the carnall professour accounteth it) a stool and a cushion, matter of ease. We must not think to be carried to heaven in a feather-bed; our faith is not <hi>sedentaria fides, a sitting,</hi> but <hi>a running faith;</hi> not an idle, but a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith; if the Poet said truely,
<q>
                        <l>

                  </p>
                  <p>If such as runne for an earthly prize, (which commonly is nothing but a whiffe of vain glorie, which perisheth in the enjoying) endure so much both in preparing themselves, and also perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the race; then what pains, what labour should seem too great to us, which runne for a heavenly and everlasting prize? we must not conceive that we are brought into this life, <hi>ad otium &amp; delicias; to be idle and voluptuous;</hi> but to sustain labour, and endure pains and sweat; not to see others runne, but to runne our selves. And therefore we are not to dream of ease and pleasure, in the possession of Christianitie, but <hi>let us runne.</hi> This life is<note n="d" place="margin">Bern.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us runne the race.]</hi> A race is a swift motion, with all earnestnesse and striving: and such must

                     <hi>through many afflictions.</hi> Which moved him to encourage Timothie, and stirre him up in these words,<note n="l" place="margin">2. Tim. 2.3.</note>
                     <hi>Thou therefore suffer affliction, as a good souldier of Jesus Christ.</hi> In the race we shall meet, and must encounter with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: though it be a race, yet it is <hi>Certamen cursori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; a running fight,</hi> or <hi>a fighting race,</hi> whether you please.

                     <hi>put on</hi> armour, even <hi>the whole armour of God,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing us in every part thereof, from the head to the foot: and that being so armed, we play the souldiers, and<note n="n" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.7.</note>
                     <hi>fight a good fight.</hi> And indeed, if the race and way were plain, and without impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, there needed no such earnest exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to inforce us to enter into it; for who would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2613:86"/> refuse? But we must runne with resolution to out-runne, and to overthrow whatsoever doth oppose us in the way. We must be like those Jews which repaired the Temple in the time of Nehemiah, which being beset with many enemies seeking to oppose and hinder them,<note n="o" place="margin">Neh. 4.17.</note>
                     <hi>wrought upon the wall with one hand, and with the other held the sword,</hi> ready to defend themselves, and beat back others that would attempt to hinder them: so must we be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite and nimble in gathering up our feet to runne the race toward heaven; and yet withall carry our weapons in our hands, ready to beat back and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all such enemies as shall oppose us, stop our course, or turn us out of the way. If this was not so, every one would be ready to enter into the race: but <hi>Hinc illae lacrymae;</hi> this is that which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the carnall man: he would gladly go to heaven, but he cannot endure to heare of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains, this running, and sweating, and fighting. He could heartily wish, with the sonnes of Zebedeus, to<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 20.21, 22.</note>
                     <hi>sit at the right hand or left hand of Christ in his kingdome:</hi> but he cannot endure to heare of <hi>drinking of his cup,</hi> nor <hi>being baptized with his baptisme of the crosse:</hi> seeing heaven must cost so deare, he had rather bid it farewell, and with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,<note n="q" place="margin">2.

                     <hi>embrace this present world.</hi> But what race is it, that with so much labour and pains, courage and fortitude must be performed of us? Let the Apostle answer in his own words, <hi>The race that is set before us.</hi> The wicked run in their race, and that very swiftly, and with great resolution:<note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note>
                     <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one turneth to his race, as the horse rusheth into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2613:87"/> the battell,</hi> through thick and thin, no dromedarie swifter: but alas! it is not in <hi>the race set before us,</hi> but in a race of their own choosing; not in the<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>strait way that leadeth unto life,</hi> but in the by-paths of sin which lead unto destruction, and the broad way which tendeth unto hell and damnation. We must not runne thus; for then the swifter we are, the more we hasten to our destruction, and the sooner we arrive at hell gates. But our race must be <hi>the race set before us,</hi> our course is limited; we must be sure to keep within the two lists or rails of the Law and the Gospel, wherein God hath set and pointed out this race before us. For therein every Christian may finde out a double race appointed by God for him to runne; 1. The generall race of Christianitie, which all without exception are bound to runne: and it is that which David promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to perform;<note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 119.32</note>
                     <hi>I will runne the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> 2. The particular race of every man his vocation or calling, concerning which the Apostle hath an expresse rule;<note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.17</note>
                     <hi>As God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.</hi> And again,<note n="x" place="margin">Vers. 20.</note>
                     <hi>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</hi> For both these callings we have full and absolute dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the word of God, in the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and whatsoever we finde therein commended unto us, that is <hi>the race set before us.</hi> This therefore doth directly crosse a double point of Poperie. First, their voluntary afflicting themselves by whippings, pilgrimages, and such other like inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own brain, for which they have no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2613:87"/> ground from the word of God, neither Law nor Gospel. This is not to<note n="x" place="margin">Mar. 8.34.</note>
                     <hi>take up the crosse of Christ and beare it,</hi> but to devise and frame a crosse unto themselves of their own devising. This is not to <hi>runne the race set before us;</hi> but a race of their own inventing, as if they were wiser then Christ, and could finde out a better way to heaven, then he hath set before us in his Gospel. Secondly, the like may be said of all manner of will-worship, whereof the greatest part of the religion of the Church of Rome consisteth; <hi>viz.</hi> their holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their holy ashes, pilgrimages, adoration of reliques, &amp;c. whereof our Saviour Christ saith,<note n="y" place="margin">Mark 7.7.</note>
                     <hi>In vain ye worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men:</hi> all which when they shall plead by way of merit at the last day, Christ will answer them as God did sometime the Jews in the like case,<note n="z" place="margin">Isa. 1.12.</note>
                     <hi>Who required these things at your hands?</hi> For these are not the race set before us, but idle inventions and traditions of men.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, by this phrase of speech, the Apostle implieth, that God is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a race-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who bringeth us into this world, as into a race, to runne, and out-runne; to strive and fight, before he give us the prize, which is the crown of glorie: and therefore our race must be directed according to his will, or else we runne in vain, and lose the prize. This consideration of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, or Master of the race, doth yeeld unto us a double use.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To stirre us up with cheerfulnesse and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie in running this spirituall race; because we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2613:88"/> have <hi>Deum praesidem cum coelesti brabio, God the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the race with the heavenly prize.</hi> Which cannot but notably encourage us in the way of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and an holy conversation; according to that which is said of our Saviour Jesus Christ, that,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12 2.</note>
                     <hi>For the joy that was set before him, he endured the crosse, despising the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The will and presence of God ought to arm us with patience and constancie against all manner of wearinesse, trouble, and difficultie in this race; especially remembring that of the Apostle,<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note>
                     <hi>God is faithfull, and will not suffer us to be tempted above that we be able, but will with the temptation also make away to escape, that we may be able to bear it:</hi> for it is as if our Saviour Christ should reach out the heavenly crown towards us, and say, Here it is; winne it, and weare it: or (as Austine saith) as if God should crie from heaven,<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>In</hi> Psal. 39.</note>
                     <hi>Specto vos, lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini adjuvabo, vincite ego vos coronabo; I behold, strive and I will help you, overcome and I will crown you.</hi> For so he promised unto the Church of Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;<note n="d" place="margin">Apoc. 1.10.</note>
                     <hi>Be thou faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</hi> And thus much shall suffice concerning the exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are to treat of the circumstances infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the exhortation, which before appeared to be three. I shall not need to repeat them, but to handle them in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first, which offereth it self to our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is the motive, or inducement to excite us to the practise of this dutie, in these words,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2613:88"/>
                     <hi>Wherefore seeing that we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses.</hi> In this inference <hi>wherefore,</hi> he sheweth to what end it was that he recited so long a<note n="e" place="margin">He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And there is an emphasis in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>let us also:</hi> If they did so happily runne the race, &amp; finish their course, much more ought we to do the like, because of our happie estate above theirs,<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 11.40.</note>
                     <hi>God providing a better thing for us, that they without us should not be perfect;</hi> they but expecting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring that which we have seen in the full comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Apostle draweth his argument <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo,</hi> because examples are matter of sense, and for the most part move more then precepts: and also to shew that he doth not perswade us to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie; because he sheweth apparently that it hath been done by others before us. It is in effect the same with that of Saint James,<note n="g" place="margin">Jam. 5.10.</note>
                     <hi>Take (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) the Prophets for an ensample of suffering ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie, and of long patience:</hi> as if he had said, Look upon the examples of the Prophets, Patriarchs, &amp; Saints of God, which have runne the race with faith and patience before you. But let us consider the words themselves: <hi>Seeing that we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses.</hi> Wherein we may observe three things. 1. Why it is called <hi>a cloud.</hi> 2. Why it is termed <hi>great.</hi> 3. Whereof it is said to consist; <hi>viz. of witnesses.</hi>

                     <hi>Regnum coelorum vim patitur, &amp; violenti rapiunt illud; The kingdome of heaven suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> A man must be earnest and zealous in his religion: for if he be but<note n="h" place="margin">Apoc. 3.16.</note>

                     <hi>ran both together,</hi> stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who should come first to the sepulchre of Christ. How much more ought we to runne, and strive to outrunne others, that we may come first to be with him in glorie?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Patience: For if we be short-winded, and faint in the way, we lose the prize, and run in vain. And this last vertue of Patience, is required for two reasons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For suffering, and enduring afflictions and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2613:96"/> other impediments: for patience will teach us to passe through all the pricks, even with joy. When we consider, or cast our eyes upon the manifold troubles, afflictions, crosses, and enemies, which we must encounter with in the way; our spirits may peradventure begin to faint and droop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: but if we lift up our eyes from the earth, and look to Christ <hi>calling,</hi> the Spirit <hi>assisting,</hi> the Father <hi>blessing,</hi> the Angels <hi>comforting,</hi> the Word <hi>directing,</hi> and the Crown <hi>inviting;</hi> it will make us like the<note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 19.15.</note> Sunne, <hi>which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a mightie giant to run his race.</hi> And therefore the Apostle insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth this motive to stirre us up to patience in the race;<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 12.2, 3.</note>
                     <hi>Looking unto Jesus the authour and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the crosse, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider</hi> therefore <hi>him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied, and faint in your mindes.</hi> Look to the prize with the cloud of witnesses; and that will give us patience in the midst of all troubles and afflictions. The hope of that made Jeremiah his <hi>prison</hi> patiently to endure, Isaiah his <hi>saw,</hi> Andrew his <hi>cruell crosse,</hi> and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his <hi>burning gridiron:</hi> this moved Peter and Andrew to <hi>imbrace,</hi> and <hi>kisse the crosse,</hi> whereon they were presently to be crucfied: for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to suffer here, because they expected a kingdome elsewhere, knowing that if they <hi>suffered with Christ,</hi> they should also be <hi>glorified with him.</hi> This filled the heart of Paul with courage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the brethren, (which besought him with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2613:96"/> teares, not to go up to Jerusalem, because the daughters of Philip the Evangelist being prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses, foretold what grievous afflictions should befall him there) in these words,<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 21.13.</note>
                     <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for I am readie not to be bound onely, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> This example is worthie of our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that so nothing may terrifie, daunt, discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or stay us in the race.

                     <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equall with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likenesse of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the crosse: Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bowe, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things

                     <p>But howsoever, seeing that in the end, or after the full close &amp; consummation of their feasting, either in generall, or each particular day, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered sacrifice for the expiation of their sinnes, wherewith they were overtaken in their feasting;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2613:102"/> it prescribeth a most excellent rule, how we should shut up and conclude our feasts and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets: <hi>viz.</hi> not having filled our selves, and pampered our flesh, then to break out into vanity, scurrilitie, profuse and lascivious gesture, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste behaviour; but to conclude our feasting with the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; with searching out the slips and errours which have overtaken us in those our meetings; and seeking by all means possible, to be reconciled again unto God, through the merit of the Propitiatorie, and All-sufficient sacrifice, Christ Jesus: as I shall after more fully observe.</p>
                     <p>This rule duely observed, would make our feasts tend to the glory of God and our own true good: whereas now, many times they prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but <hi>incentiva libidinis; provocations unto sinne.</hi> And howsoever we take it, every waies it set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth Jobs alacritie, diligence, constancy, and perseverance in his setled course of pietie towards God; he still was the same, he still had the same care. <hi>Familiaritas sacrorum nullum efficiebat contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum, nullam acediam; The custome of sacrifices, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mysteries, caused no contempt, nor wearinesse.</hi> He was not like many amongst us, which are very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and zealous for a fit, and then as suddenly wax cold again, and being weary, desist from their former course of pietie.

                     <p>The manner of Jobs performing of this dutie, is expressed in these words, <hi>Job sent and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, and rose up early in the morning:</hi> And it consisteth in these two things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the preparing of his children: <hi>Job sent and sanctified them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In his own forwardnesse, and diligence: <hi>And rose up early in the morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. First his care is, that his children may be in solemn manner prepared; not so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their feasting, as of the sacrifice to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God. <hi>Job sent and sanctified them]</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen saith, <hi>Quid mittebat? What did he send?</hi> and answereth, <hi>His prayers to God, with confession, and thanksgiving for his sonnes.</hi> Which may indeed be true, but yet seemeth not so proper to the scope of the place. Eugubinus hath a conceit, that Job sent sacrifices to the temple, to sanctifie them: which cannot be true, because that Job lived so long before the building of the temple; yea it is conceived, that he was born<note n="d" place="margin">Vid. specim. Digest. pag. <hi>6. 9. 26.</hi>
                        </note> above two hundred yeares before the law was given in mount Sinai; which was above seven hundred yeares before So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon did build the Temple at Jerusalem. It is more probable, that the sense here is, that he sent a messenger unto them, to will them to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2613:103"/> themselves, and so to be present at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which he purposed to offer unto God on their behalf. Of that opinion is<note n="e" place="margin">In locum.</note> Tremellius, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mittens, sanctificationem imperavit, ut mundati sacrificio sequenti interessent; Sending, he charged them to sanctifie themselves, that being made clean they might be present at the ensuing sacrifice.</hi> His sending sheweth that he was absent from them: for they dwelt in their severall houses, wherein they feasted each other: and yet his fatherly care for them ceased not, which made one to say,<note n="f" place="margin">Lyra.</note>
                        <hi>Quid praesens ageret, ubi absens cura non deest? What would he have done had he been present with them, seeing his care for them is not wanting, when they are absent from him? And sanctified them]</hi> The original word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies properly <hi>to be holy,</hi> or <hi>separated from profane and common use,</hi> and <hi>consecrated to God,</hi> or his service. But, by a Metaphor, it often signifies <hi>to prepare;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such as are without holines are unprepared.

But it is more generally understood of the persons: and so the number of <hi>seven,</hi> seemeth more probable then the number of <hi>ten;</hi> because in the latter end of the verse, where Job expresseth the reason why he offered these sacrifices, we finde mention onely of his sonnes, and not of his daughters. It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that by <hi>sacrifices</hi> then, the ordinarie means and principall part of Gods service be sought, to make an atonement for the sinnes of his sonnes, and to reconcile them unto God, whom he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed they had provoked by their sinnes. And I doubt not, but his sacrifices were accompanied with prayers unto God for remission of sinnes, and thanksgiving for the manifold benefits conferred upon himself, and his sonnes and daughters, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And what doth this example in Job teach us? That whensoever any of us do finde, or fear that we have with Jobs sonnes sinned against God, and provoked him to wrath and indignation against us, we seek to be reconciled unto God, and restored into his favour again, by that one perfect, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and all-sufficient oblation, or sacrifice of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is the summe

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2613:110"/> in their hearts? From the late frequency of their feasting: for such meetings are for the most part seasoned, or mixed with immoderate pleasures, vain joy of the heart, loquacity, scurrility, and other intemperate words and gestures.

Now the daies of our feasting are gone about. Let no man think, that it is my purpose to inveigh against feasting in generall: I know that it hath been used by some of the<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 21.8. Judg. 14.10.</note> Patriarchs, and by divers other Saints and holy men of God. And our Saviour Christ vouchsafed both his presence, and his first<note n="n" place="margin">Joh. 2.1, 2. &amp;c.</note> miracle, at a feast celebrated at a marriage in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2613:111"/> Cana of Galilee. And certainly our Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in this kinde is not taken away. I onely desire that Job may be our president therein, that so our feasts may be the more pleasing unto God, and comfortable to our selves: for his example here doth teach us how to behave our selves in, and after our feastings.</p>
                     <p>At, and in our feasts, we must carry our selves soberly with Christian moderation and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, expressing a godly care, not to sinne against God in our hearts, by vain or ungodly thoughts; and much more, that we do not provoke his wrath and indignation against us, by vain words and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full actions.</p>
                     <p>Now, and at all times after our feasting, let us learn, with holy Job, to have a godly jealousie and suspicion (parents over their children, masters over their servants, and every one of us over our own selves) lest we have sinned against God in our thoughts, words, or actions. We should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a serious scrutinie of our hearts and souls, whether we have not in these assemblies by our evil thoughts, vile words, and wicked actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and kindled the Lords wrath and anger against us. And if we finde (as the most, I fear, may) that too much vanitie hath overtaken us in our thoughts, and too much intemperance in our words and actions; let us with Job <hi>rise up early,</hi> and make haste to come before the Lord with the sacrifices of<note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 51.16.</note>
                        <hi>a broken spirit, and a broken and contrite heart, which God will not despise,</hi> and of prayer, and praise and thanksgiving; and seek to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2613:111"/> pacifie his anger, and to be reconciled unto him by the perfect and absolute sacrifice of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note>
                        <hi>in whom alone he is well pleased.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Last of all, I beseech you that are, or shall be parents of children, to learn of Job, to remit some part of your immoderate care and anxietie, to heap up wordly mammon for them, and <hi>rise up early,</hi> that is, bestow your first and chief care, for the purchase of the favour of God, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessings, and treasures for them. Beleeve it, you shall finde it the best way to make your children happie, and to increase and continue your houses: for the love and favour of God is infinitely more worth then all the treasures of the world. What are the riches and jewels, yea and all the pomp and glory of the kingdomes of the earth, to the heavenly graces of the holy Spirit of God, which decks and adorns the soul?</p>
                     <p>These rules if we duely observe in our feastings, and thus if we alwaies carry this godly care and jealousie over our children, we shall be blessed in our selves, we shall be blessed in our seed and posteritie, blessed in our feasting, blessed in our fasting, blessed in our souls, and blessed in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, blessed in this life, and eternally blessed and happie in the life to come. Unto which thrice blessed and glorious estate he bring us, who hath so dearely bought us, with the price of his most precious bloud. To whom, with the Father and the holy Spirit, be all honour and glory now and for evermore. Amen.</p>
